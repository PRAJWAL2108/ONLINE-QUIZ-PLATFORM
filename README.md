# ONLINE-QUIZ-PLATFORM

Online quizzes are a popular form of entertainment for web surfers. Online quizzes are generally
free to play and for entertainment purposes only though some online quiz websites offer prizes.
Web sites provide online questionnaires on many topics ranging from history to science to
geography and so on. Online quizzes also test the individual's level of understanding of the topic they
are taking the quiz on.
This project is a basic idea of how full stack development and web technologies
components/structures such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
JavaScript (JS), React, etc. work.
